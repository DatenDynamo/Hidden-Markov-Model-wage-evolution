# Hidden-Markov-Model-wage-evolution
time series modelling of wage evolution using Hidden Markov Model

This project is dedicated to the development of code for my
bachelor's thesis titled "Statistical analyses for time series modeling of wage evolution using Hidden Markov Models." 
The code primarily revolves around the implementation and visualization of Hidden Markov Models to analyze and predict wage changes over time.
